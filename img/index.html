<h3>“The greater the level of calmness of our mind, the greater our peace of mind, the greater our ability to enjoy a happy and joyful life.” - Dalai Lama</h3>

      <p> Calma is the Spanish word for calmness. Calmness is a mental state of peace of mind being free from agitation, excitement or disturbance.<sup>(1)</sup> Our environment and its relationship with color and design play an important role when it comes to reducing stress. It can affect our moods and reactions in a variety of ways. My goal with Calma is to bring calm evoking designs to people and organizations looking to have interiors that provide a sense of tranquility to reduce stress and anxiety and improve emotional wellbeing.</p>

      <h4>DIDACTIC & PROCESS</h4>
      <h6>Problem Statement</h6>
      <p>According to the World Health Organization, stress has been called the “health epidemic of the 21st Century”.<sup>(2)</sup> The impact of stress on our health is alarming and finding ways to reduce it can help society live a longer, healthier life. By understanding how color and shape can influence our mood, it will help us make better choices in bringing comfort and tranquility into our surroundings and enhance our lives.</p>
      <h6>Research</h6>
      <p>To create the designs, I had to understand the psychological and physiological response to color and shape, and its calming and therapeutic properties. I met with mental health professionals specializing in trauma, art therapy, design expertise and people suffering some levels of stress or anxiety. I also visited a women’s shelter for victims of domestic violence, a high school and a center for yoga and meditation.</p>
      <h6>Process</h6>
      <p>I began sketching my designs based off my research on shape and its relationship with emotion. Curved lines evoke positive responses while sharp lines evoke negative ones. <sup>(3)</sup> For that reason, I incorporated lineal elements that had flowing and wave forms. As for color choice, color is one of the first elements that people respond to, so it was important I created the color palettes from hues that inspire peace and calm. For the eight designs I created, I chose blue, green, pink and purple hues as they are clinically known to have calming properties.</p>

      <p>Feedback was crucial to finalize my designs. I met with potential users as well as professionals to hear their input on my designs. Some of the feedback I received and considered was to tone down the pink shades and keep it simple. The less for the eyes to pick through, the more serene. Other feedback included keeping elements that show slow movement such as a lake or ocean. Anything with the earth tends to be more calming.</p>

      <p>To show how my designs could exist in the real world, I needed to create mock-up images of the spaces with my designs. For that, it was necessary to find the right facilities were my designs could influence wellness in positive ways, either psychologically or through therapy. I visited and met with staff at a shelter for victims of domestic violence, a high school and a center for yoga and meditation. I photographed the spaces and applied my designs to the images through Photoshop.</p>

      <p>Comparing feedback from a design perspective vs a psychological one was very interesting. It gave me a new way of interpreting my designs. I learned that what works aesthetically doesn’t necessarily work for therapeutic purposes. Of the eight designs I created, there were some that I didn’t think would be favorites. After hearing what my interviewees had to say after seeing the mock-up images, to my surprise they ended being top in preference.</p>
